In this tutorial you will learn how to create your first Burst account, to validate it and to understand its interface.

## Prerequisites

- An online wallet or an installed & preferably synced local wallet

---

## Instructions

### Create an account

When opening your wallet, you should see a login screen similar to this :

The first step will be to create a new account. Click on the text "Don't have an account? Click here to create one!". You can either use the automatically generated passphrase or choose your own by clicking "Want to choose your own passphrase ? Click here."

!!! warning
    **Make sure to pick an *extremely* secure passphrase!** Using the generated 12 words passphrase is recommended. You might also want to add words of your choice or special characters just in case.

!!! warning
    **Make sure to backup your passphrase on multiple locations, including on paper! LOST PASSPHRASES CANNOT BE RECOVERED AND WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THE ACCOUNT!**

!!! tip
    You can create a "vault" account with a very secure passphrase to hold the majority of your funds, and another account with a shorter passphrase to make your daily transactions.

Validate your account's passphrase.

You are now in front of the Burst wallet interface.

Important attributes of the Burst wallet interface are highlighted here:

- Top Left: your wallet's name
- Top Right: Send Burst / Message
- Along the Left: advanced Burst wallet functionality
- Center: Your recent transactions (this should be empty at this point)
- Bottom Right: The 10 most recent blocks on the blockchain

### Validate your account

Now we have to go through the process of validating your Burst account.

!!! note "Why does the account need to be validated?"
    Any passphrase you type into the wallet is run through an algorithm and “points” at a particular Burst address. Each possible Burst address can have more than one passphrase that works for it until it has a public key generated (or “activated”) by a transaction. Once this activating transaction is made, only your particular passphrase works for this Burst address now. Thus, completely securing it.

It is not easy for someone to find a passphrase for a Burst address that hasn’t been activated, but it is much harder for someone to find the passphrase after it is activated.

The goal here will be to create your public key spending as little Burst as possible. You should only need one single Burst. The coin you have is precious… don’t waste it! There will be two scenarios:
- **You are either going to just hold Burst in your account, or to solo mine.** The easiest way now is to just name your account. This only costs one Burst. Click on “No Name Set” in the top left corner of your wallet. Type in whatever you want to name your wallet in the field under “Name”. Keep in mind that this information is publicly available! Anything you type into the “Name” or “Description” field can be read by other people, so don’t put anything private in there such as your passphrase!
- **You are planning on mining on a pool.** If you change your reward recipient to your chosen pool (steps are explained in the "mining" tutorial), your account will be activated. After changing reward recipient, you need to wait 4 blocks for the change to take effect (10-20 minutes on average).

Your account is now activated. Just remember to keep your Burst wallet passphrase handy, but most importantly very secure.

Happy Bursting!
